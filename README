NIGNX subfilter module - is a replacement for default subfilter module with support for multiple patterns under the same configuration context.

It uses fast Wu-Manber algorithm for multi-pattern search.

The syntax is the same. Except that 'sub_filter_once' currently is not supported.
You can use several 'sub_filter' directives as follows:

sub_filter string1 replacement1;
sub_filter string2 replacement2;
...
sub_filter stringN replacementN;
